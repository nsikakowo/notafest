# NATOFEST DOCUMENTATION

This is an events webapp that allows visitors to register for an event, select their ticket class submit and print out a qr code which will be presented at the event venue to allow for entrance into the arena.

## Technology used

This project is built with 
    -Reactjs, 
    -TailwindCSS and some vanilla CSS 
    -Form validation using React-hook-form because it handles rerendering pefectly and is faster than any othe method and mor secured
    - Icons are gotten from React-icons as it eliminates the issue of sourcing and preparing icons, and its a veruy light dependency


## Deployment
This project can be deployed manually by running yarn run build or npm run build as the case maybe and using the build folder as your source files which can be deployed to your host via FTP or otherwise
Also, it is currently hosted on https://notafest.netlify.app for your viewing pleasure.


## NB:

Project is fully responsive and optimized for small, ultrawide and handheld devices.
Navigation on the header is not yet functional as i intend to take a very different route with that module hence overlooking it for now.
I intend to continue update this project in the future, maybe for learning purposes or who knows even use it for an actual event.
